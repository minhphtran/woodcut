# woodcut

Simple tkinter app to optimise the way wood pieces should be cut (linear programming). The goal is to make as many products (crates) as possible using the available wood. They are recycled wood with wildly different sizes.

In our case, we need for 1 crate:
 - 11 pieces of 40cm
 - 6 pieces of 36.4cm
 - 2 pieces of 34cm
 - 2 pieces of 17.6cm
 
For each cut, we lose .5cm to the saw.

These values were hard-coded.

We use the planer to flatten the wood to the correct thickness beforehand, so here I ignore the thickness.

The results:
